        <div id="comments">
            <p>You're in a train, somewhere in France, heading to Paris. Those past 2 days in la Rochelle, France, were
                great.
                Very good conference at the 2nd <a href="http://www.jugsummercamp.org/">JUG Summer Camp</a>. This is a
                good
                conference in the south-west of France, organized by SERLI. One of the most interesting
                session was an one hour live coding by David Gageot.</P>

            <P>David and I are good friend. We're both members of the Java community
                for a few years. We usually talk at the same conference. This year I did a Keynote, and David wrote its
                own
                Web framework in one hour. This guy is a great developer. With an Eclipse, some SimpleHTTP, a bit of
                Google
                Guava and a lot of energy, he wrote a simple HTTP application in less than 40 minuts.</p>

            <p>This was to demonstrate that maybe, we don't really need any web framework. Its demo was exactly what
                you're looking at : select the cuttiest cat, that's all. I decided to wrote a Play! Framework version
                of its demo, and it tooks me 3 hours. I spent a lot of time on the jQuery side, not being
                a Jedi master in this area.</p>

            <P>Kudo to Guillaume Bort for this great framework, I love Play! Framework.</p>
