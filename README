CatApp is a simple Play! Framework application to demonstrate some of the most simple feature
of the Play! Framework. I wrote this application in a train, somewhere between the souht-west
of France and Paris. This was after the JUG Summer Camp conference. David Gageot did a great
presentation of a simple approach to write a Web application in less than 35 minuts.
His subject was exactly the same idea I took : pick 2 cats pictures, select wich one is hot, that's it!
Remember the "Social Network" movie ? Where Mark Z. from Facebook wrote this in PHP in one night ?
Basically, we have the same kind of applicaiton. With no Internet connection in the train I couldn't
get student's pictures. So you have baby cat. Sorry dude.

Pour les Francophone : CatApp c'est "T'es cap ?".
Est-ce que tu es cap' de coder une application en moins de 3 heures ? Un truc tout simple ?
Je vous conseille la conférence du JUG Summer Camp à la Rochelle dans le sud-ouest de la France.
Très bon souvenir.
